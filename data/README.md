This folder contains the data that is not generated by the simulations.

small_pillars.xlsx
==================

Data communicated by Ville Liimatainen. Snapin and pull-off forces of a droplet touching pillars with diameters ranging between 20 µm and 100 µm. Other experimental parameters: probe disk diameter 1 mm, droplet weight was 15 µN (corresponding to a volume of ~ 1.53 µl). The experiments were conducted in ordinary room temperature, but the exact temperature was not recorded.

contact angles and big pillars.xlsx
===================================

Data communicated by Ville Liimatainen. Snapin and pull-off forces of a droplet touching pillars with diameters ranging between 200 µm and 800 µm. Other experimental parameters: probe disk diameter 1 mm, droplet weight was 15 µN (corresponding to a volume of ~ 1.53 µl). The experiments were conducted in ordinary room temperature, but the exact temperature was not recorded.

butt_data.mat
=============

Data communicated by Hans-Jürgen Butt. Force as a function of distance from a flat surface with a known contact angle. These are computational results, and have originally been reported in:

Butt, H.-J. et al. "Characterization of super liquid-repellent surfaces" *Curr. Opin. Colloid Interface Sci.* **19**, 343–354 (2014).
